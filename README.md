##About
This project consists of a HTML web form that once completed, it posts the data received to a second page in order to confirm the information is correct. If the data isn't right, it is possible to go back and change it. If it is correct, it can be submitted, and the program will send it by email. It will give a last message confirming the email was sent or informing it wasn't possible to send. 


## Tech used
Built with 
* PHP
* PHPMailer
* CSS
  

## demo
https://simple-web-contact-form.herokuapp.com/

For security reasons, the email address, and the password has been removed, so in the demo the program is not sending the emails.

## Installation
To build this project it was necessary to install PHPMailer. I did it via composer running 
```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```
